## A01 - Basic GitHub Setup

### Description:

This folder contains the documentation for the first lab activity in 4443-IoT. This introductory lab exhibits basic use and code examples for the Arduino as well as basic hardware implementation of LEDs and resistors. 

### Introduction Work
Getting familiar with the breadboard and hardware components is a central aspect of this course, but with no prior knowledge, I had to start somewhere. To do so, I wired a simple circuit from the arduino to the anode of the LED, and put a 220Î© resistor on the cathode side before wiring the circuit back to ground. This simple schematic is pictured below followed by pictures of the physical circuit

Below is the basic code snippet to provide power to the pin
```ino
void setup() 
{
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);      // Set pin 5 to output voltage
  digitalWrite(5, HIGH);   // Output voltage through pin 5
}

void loop() 
{}
```
### Expanded Code (Blinking LED)
On the code side, it was a simple tweak to change this circuit to make the LED flash on and off every second. Simply moving the `digitalWrite(5, HIGH)` command to the loop function, using `delay(1000)` to pause the runtime for 1 second, and adding `digitalWrite(5, LOW)` to turn the LED off, and delaying again as shown below.

```ino
void setup() 
{
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(5, HIGH); // Turns LED on if in source config
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(5, LOW);  // Turns LED off
  delay(1000);
}
```
