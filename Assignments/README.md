### AI Disclaimer
Some README files for documents have been enhanced using AI for viewing/reading pleasure. AI Enhanced READMEs will be clearly marked using `üõ†Ô∏è TLDR (AI Enhanced)` at the top of the document. These sections were generated using my hand-typed description in a prompt for some AI, typically ChatGPT. My hand-typed version will be found below this section, clearly marked `Full Description`. Everything within this sections of the README is 100% human typed with minimal exceptions, and these exceptions are clearly marked.
