### AI Disclaimer
Some README files for documents have **been enhanced using AI** for viewing/reading pleasure. AI Enhanced READMEs will be clearly marked using `üõ†Ô∏è TLDR (AI Enhanced)` at the top of the document. These sections were generated using my hand-typed description in a prompt to some AI, typically ChatGPT. My hand-typed version will be found below this section, clearly marked `Full Description`. Everything within this sections of the README is 100% human typed with minimal exceptions, and these exceptions are clearly marked.

**I chose to use AI for this course for numerous reasons.** First and foremost, it is often encouraged by our professor who follows a similar belief on what AI should be used for. I would not be using AI if I had not been encouraged to or if it were against the rules. At MSU, use of AI is (currently) at the discretion of the professor, and I will adhere to the rules laid out for each class in their respective syllabus. Obviously, in this class, using AI is allowed, so long as we credit it properly. 

Additionally, I am a very verbose writer, and I like to explain things, whether they need to be explained or not (You can probably notice this reading this very disclaimer). Upon writing my description for Lab 3, I realized this led to my READMEs becoming unecessarily long and more of a chore to read as it was hard to distinguish important details from context. This led me to ponder the idea of rewriting them entirely using AI. I quickly shot down this idea because that would mean I spent hours writing the detailed description just to cut it out for something slightly more organized. 

I compromised the idea by implementing a TLDR section which summarizes everything in a concise and organized way, and fully crediting this section to AI takes any guilt away. Finally, using AI openly in this course will allow me to further develop how I utilize, reference, and credit AI in future work. In the past, I have been inconsistent, and since AI is most definitely apart of the future, I see it as necessary to start using it in an official manner.

**My personal view on AI** (fully aware that I am a university student at the time of writing) is that it should be utilized as a tool to boost personal efficiency, typically in the form of discovering errors quickly, summarizing large walls of text, and other orgnizational tasks. Additionally, I see that AI tools are great standardized learning resource for surface-level information. I believe the issue is when we use AI to accomplish things we do not know how to do ourselves. This leads to not "exercising" our brain and ultimately weakening it. I see that becoming dependent on AI to do mentally-taxing tasks is a slippery slope, and one I do not intend to fall down in my career.
