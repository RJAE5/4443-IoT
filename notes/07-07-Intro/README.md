### Breadboard Basics
Blue is ground, red is power.

The outside works on rows (the long way)
However, if you powered an inner section, it would only work on the column.

### LEDs
Annode is positive, and often the bent end.
The straight end is negative, called the cathode.

### Code Basics
A setup function and a main loop function. He didn't explain much.
```
setup()
{

}

loop()
{

}
```

If you get specific, you will have to start specifying what pins to work with on the arduino

### IDE
`circuito.io` is a good one
